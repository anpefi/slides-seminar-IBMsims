## GOALS
- Understand what is a simulation
---

## What is a (computer) simulation?

- An attempt to mimic a real-world empirical system
- The creation *in silico* of a possible world using computer programs to represent the processes under consideration
---

## Simulations as experimental systems

- Models could be as complex as the real systems they mimic
- A huge advantage: **models are strongly manipulable**
- Simulation models are properly explored using the same experimental and statistical techniques that are used to explore real-world systems

---

## genetic data simulation algorithms
- Backward-time (Coalescent)
- **Fordward-time**
- Resampling

---

## Building a simulation study

Made a figure with the chart in the 2010 book chapter
